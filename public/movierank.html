<h1>The Best Movies According to Stephen</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>This movie is an amazing look into the human elements of war.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>
  This movie is mind bending. I had to watch it a few times before i understood
  all of it
</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Is it apparent I like Christopher Nolan?</p>
